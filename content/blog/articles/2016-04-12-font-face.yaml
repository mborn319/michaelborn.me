  Please note this article uses markdown to format the article body. The blog articles are stored in text files with the .yaml extension. Yaml files allow you to edit a list of keys and values as well as a body of text.

  This system uses [https://github.com/Modularr/YAML-FrontMatter](FrontMatter) to read the YAML files
