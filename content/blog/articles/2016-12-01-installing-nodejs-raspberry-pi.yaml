summary: How to install Node.JS v6.x on an ARMV6 Raspberry Pi.
---
For the final step of my [BoomBox capstone project][1], I needed to install Boombox (and thus Node.JS) on my Raspberry Pi, which happens to be a Model A+. So I ran `sudo apt install nodejs npm`, but quickly realized that this only installed node version 0.10.x, not sure why at this point.

So, I uninstalled via `sudo apt remove nodejs npm`, and tried to use `nodesource` to install Node version 4.x.

``` bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -
## Installing the NodeSource Node.js v4.x LTS Argon repo...

### You appear to be running on ARMv6 hardware. Unfortunately this is not currently supported by the NodeSource Linux distributions. Please use the 'linux-armv6l' binary tarballs available directly from nodejs.org for Node.js v4 and later.
```

Turns out nodesource does not support ARMV6, only the newer ARMV7 and ARMV8. Obviously, if you have ARMV7 or ARMV8, I believe the above command would work perfectly fine for you.

## Installing Node.JS ARMV6 from Binaries
Thankfully, the steps to install are in the nodesource error message above: _"Please use the 'linux-armv6l' binary tarballs available directly from nodejs.org for Node.js v4 and later."_

### Download AMRV6 Tarball
Head to the [nodejs.org downloads page][2] and grab the URL of the ARMV6 download link (in this case [https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.9.1/node-v6.9.1-linux-armv6l.tar.xz][3]). Notice the downloads page says this is a binary download, which means

1. no need to waste time waiting for a slow-as-all-get-out Raspberry Pi to compile Node
1. you don't have to worry about cross-compiling (see 1)

First, we're going to download the binaries into our `/usr/src` directory.
``` bash
$ cd /usr/local/src
$ wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.9.1/node-v6.9.1-linux-armv6l.tar.xz
```

### Uncompress the Tarball
Once you uncompress the downloaded tarball, you can inspect the files and see that the `node` binary is located at `node-v6.9.1-linux-armv6l/bin/node`.
``` bash
$ tar -xvf node-v6.9.1-linux-armv6l.tar.xz
$ cd node-v6.9.1-linux-armv6l/
$ ls -l
```

### Add Node Symlink
Now that we have node "installed", we just need to link to the `node` binary from a PATH directory. We'll do this with a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`. 
``` bash
sudo ln -s /usr/src/node-v6.9.1-linux-armv6l/bin/node /usr/local/bin/nodejs
```

If you want, you can setup a `node` symbolic link which just points to the `node` symbolic link.
```
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/nodejs /usr/local/bin/node
```

### It Works?
Just to make sure...
``` bash
$ node --version
v6.9.1
$ npm --version
4.0.2
```

Booyah!
