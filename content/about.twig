## Education 

  * Computer Information Systems, AAS - MVCC - 2014
  * Web Development &amp; Information Design, AAS - MVCC - 2014
  * Computer Information Systems, BS - SUNY Polytechnic Institute - in progress

## Experience
**I have built large corporate websites**, and I have built small mom-and-pop sites. I have overcome email clients (Outlook!) and browsers (IE, sigh), optimized SQL queries and page load, and interfaced with nearly a dozen API's on my jaunt through the web development world.
**I interned at the Griffiss Air Force Base** in summer of 2015. I spent the summer debugging and documenting C++, Java, and Bash programs, as well as learning advanced networking and communications theory from my coworkers.
**In my four years as a professional web developer**, I have learned how to build emails for Outlook as well as Gmail, I have integrated with numerous APIs (see list below), and coded dozens (upon dozens) of website frontends.

  * Google Analytics API
  * Google Maps API
  * Youtube IFrame API
  * Youtube Data API
